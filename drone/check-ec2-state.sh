Usage:

$( basename "$0" ) instance-name [state] [poll-freq] [poll-attempts]

A simple script to check and/or optionally wait for an AWS EC2 instance state
to change to a predefined value.

    options:

        instance-name:  The AWS EC2 instance-name to check.

        state:          The state to check for.

        poll-freq:      The frequency to re-poll in seconds.

        poll-attempts:  The amount of attempts to make before exiting.
                        Specify a non-positive integer to infinately poll. By
                        default $default_poll_attempts attempts will be made
                        before exiting.

    examples:

        $( basename "$0" ) i-0000000000

            Will output the current state of an instance.

        $( basename "$0" ) i-0000000000 running

            Will output the current state of an instance and exit with a non-
            zero status code if the instance isn't in the given state.

        $( basename "$0" ) i-0000000000 running 1

            Will check the current state of the instance and re-poll every 1
            second until the desired state is reached, then exit. By
            default $default_poll_attempts attempts will be made before exiting.

        $( basename "$0" ) i-0000000000 running 1 100

            Will check the current state of the instance 100 times and re-poll
            every 1 second until the instance is running or 100 attempts have
            been made, then exit.
